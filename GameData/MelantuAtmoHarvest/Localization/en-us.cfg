    #LOC_MAH_manufacturer_title = Epsilon Engineering
    #LOC_MAH_manufacturer_description = A small engineering consultant group for many years, Epsilon Engineering has recently entered the manufacturing sector after intern Melantu Kerman had some bright ideas and was given a little too much time to develop them. 
    
    // PARTS

	#LOC_MAH_MOXIE_title = Melantu Oxidizer-Fuel ISRU Experiment
	#LOC_MAH_MOXIE_desc = Better known as "MOXIE", this device separates the Carbon Dioxide in the Atmospheres of Duna, Eve, Kerbin, and Laythe and combines it with a small amount of Liquid Hydrogen to produce Oxidizer and Liquid Fuel. Good for rover experiments and slow ISRU Conversions

	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_default = Separating CO2 for fun and profit!

	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_KerbinFlyingLow = The amount of CO2 decreases slowly as you increase in altitude
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_KerbinFlyingHigh = There's probably not enough CO2 up here to be useful
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_KerbinSrfLanded = I'm not sure why you're trying to make fuel on a planet that has tanks full of fuel just sitting around
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_KerbinSrfSplashed = If you wanted to make water with this gizmo, you're in luck: you're floating in water right now

	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_EveFlyingLow = The amount of CO2 up here is disturbingly high. Mission control thinks this may be a bad sign of things to come.
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_EveFlyingHigh = The CO2 is leaking into the storage tank. That's a new one.
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_EveSrfLanded = As you open up the atmospheric intake, you gasp in awe and horror and ask yourself "is there a such thing as too much CO2?"
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_EveSrfSplashed = The sensor is picking up strange readings. It might be consistent with rocket fuel vapors coming off this ocean. Maybe it's a good thing there's no Oxygen here

	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_DunaFlyingLow = There's practically no atmosphere up here, but the high CO2 concentration is promising.
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_DunaFlyingHigh = This might be enough CO2 to fuel the converter all the way up here.
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere may be thin, but it's almost pure CO2. It's almost as if we designed this gadget for this situation.

	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_JoolFlyingLow = It looks like we can't separate any CO2, seeing as there's no CO2 on this planet. Still, a negative result is still a result.
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_JoolFlyingHigh = The device is starting to be crushed by the immense atmospheric pressures. Still no CO2.

	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_LaytheFlyingLow = This is a lot like Kerbin, except slightly less atmosphere.
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_LaytheFlyingHigh = It looks like we separated one whole molecule of CO2.
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_LaytheSrfLanded = Yep, this is definitely a thinner version of Kerbin's atmosphere. It still looks like we can make fuel though.
	#LOC_MAH_ScienceDef_MOXIE_LaytheSrfSplashed = This salty ocean might corrode some parts and decrease our efficiency.
