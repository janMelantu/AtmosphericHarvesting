	#LOC_MAH_MOXIE_title = Melantu Oxidizer-Fuel ISRU Experiment
	#LOC_MAH_MOXIE_desc = Better known as "MOXIE", this device separates the Carbon Dioxide in the Atmospheres of Duna, Eve, Kerbin, and Laythe and combines it with a small amount of Liquid Hydrogen to produce Oxidizer and Liquid Fuel. Good for rover experiments and slow ISRU Conversions
